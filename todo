1. tests for huffman and inputprocessing



other ideas:
String = filename
[String] = parse text directly
TextAnalysis objects

missing value is "<missing>"
don't update for missing things

make vocab, ngrams and priorityqueue maybe a frequency table (only for neg sampling)


for CBOW make input vector
