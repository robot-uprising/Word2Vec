add ngram fuction and return ngrams from inputprocessing
add array of strings as string literal input in inputprocessing
use ispath to check string for file name?

figure out whether a Tracked array from Flux will update properly
tests of network
clean up interface





otehr ideas:
String = filename
[String] = parse text directly
TextAnalysis objects

missing value is "<missing>"
don't update for missing things

take in the text
parse into sentences
internal represntation of sentences is an array
make vocab, ngrams and priorityqueue maybe a frequency table (only for neg sampling)

pass vocab and pq to hufftree and get huffman tree

for CBOW make input vector
