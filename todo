should nodepaths returned from allpaths be unique?  no there is one set of nodes
that is the same, the longest, and is only differentiated by the last branch
choice

so iterate across all contexts:
  how to tell when they are done?
  randomly cycle through them all
    make a set
    randomly choose one, if empty remove, if not, train

struct for data
  set of available stuff
  context states
  contexts

  iterate method randomly chooses an element from the set, if it returns nothing, remove it

to get a value inside an even context Int(floor(length(context)/2))

other ideas:
String = filename
[String] = parse text directly
TextAnalysis objects

missing value is "<missing>"
don't update for missing things

make vocab, ngrams and priorityqueue maybe a frequency table (only for neg sampling)


for CBOW make input vector
